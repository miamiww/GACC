####Hey here is some stuff about me
This is my twitter [@miamiworldwide][twitterLink]

I am interested in human-centered machine learning, cyberfeminism, new media,
and performance art.

####
My favorite artists right are [**Physical Education**](physsicalleduucaionn.wordpress.com/about), a dance collective from
Portland. I just finished working on a project with them and it was a ton of
fun.

My favorite artist working in SF is [**Laetitia Sonami**](www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laetitia_Sonami).  She is a sound and
performance artist who built a new instrument called the Lady's Glove.
